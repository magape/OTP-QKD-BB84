# OTP-QKD-BB84

## QKD: quantum key, ultimate secrecy.

This repository contains my project [Encryption in Python](https://github.com/magape/OTP-QKD-BB84/blob/main/Encryption%20in%20Python.md) for the [Qubit by Qubit's Introduction to Quantum Computing](https://www.qubitbyqubit.org/programs) course.

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to [The Coding School](https://the-cs.org/) for offering the Introduction to Quantum Computing course. This course provided a strong foundation in the fundamentals of quantum computing, which greatly aided in the completion of the final project. 

I am grateful to [Google Quantum AI](https://quantumai.google/) for their scholarship that supported my participation in The Coding School's Introduction to Quantum Computing course.

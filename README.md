message = "QKD: quantum key, ultimate secrecy."

This repository contains my project "Encryption in Python" for the Qubit by Qubit's Introduction to Quantum Computing course.
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to [The Coding School](https://the-cs.org/) for offering the Introduction to Quantum Computing course. This course provided a strong foundation in the fundamentals of quantum computing, which greatly aided in the completion of the final project. I am grateful to Google Quantum AI for their scholarship that supported my participation in The Coding School's Introduction to Quantum Computing course.
